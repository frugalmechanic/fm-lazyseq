/**
 * For LazySeq.grouped
 * 
 * Passing a non-null additionalIncrement function allows you to increment the count
 * by an additional custom amount depending on the item.  For example, items might take up
 * different amounts of memory or cost different amounts to process.  You could
 * pass in a custom additionalIncrement to account for that such that calling
 * LazySeq.grouped might give you IndexedSeqs of differing sizes but you could
 * try to keep the amount of memory or processing time more uniform.
